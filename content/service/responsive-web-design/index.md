description: "Responsive web design is a digital design approach that ensures a website's layout and content respond or adapt to the screen size and orientation of the device from which it is accessed. This design strategy enhances user experience by providing optimal readability and navigation with minimal resizing, panning, and scrolling, regardless of whether a user is accessing the site from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone."
